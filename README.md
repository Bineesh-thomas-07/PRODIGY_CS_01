# Caesar Cipher Program

This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar cipher, which can be used for both encryption and decryption of messages. The program allows you to input a message, choose a shift value, and select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message using the Caesar cipher technique.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Shift each letter in the message by a specified number of positions down the alphabet.
- **Decryption**: Reverse the shift to get the original message.
- **Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters**.
- **Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers, etc.) remain unchanged**.
- **Interactive command-line interface**.

## How it Works

The Caesar cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number. For example, with a shift of 3:
- 'A' becomes 'D'
- 'B' becomes 'E'
- 'Z' becomes 'C'

For decryption, the program shifts the letters in the opposite direction, effectively undoing the encryption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the program, you need to have Python installed on your computer. The code is written in Python 3.x, so make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check if Python is installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Running the Program

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you have saved the project files.
3. Run the following command to start the program:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

or

```bash
python3 caesar_cipher.py
```

4. The program will display an interactive menu where you can choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.

### Example Usage

- **Encryption**:
    - Message: `hello`
    - Shift value: `3`
    - Action: `encrypt`
    - Encrypted message: `khoor`

- **Decryption**:
    - Message: `khoor`
    - Shift value: `3`
    - Action: `decrypt`
    - Decrypted message: `hello`

## Code Overview

1. **caesar_cipher(text, shift)**:
    - This function takes in a string `text` and an integer `shift`, then shifts each letter of the string by the given amount. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters and ignores non-alphabetic characters.

2. **main()**:
    - This function provides a simple command-line interface for the user to interact with the program. It allows the user to input a message, a shift value, and choose whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the message.

## Example Run

```
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Program!

1. Encrypt/Decrypt a message
2. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter your message: hello
Enter the shift value (integer): 3
Do you want to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' the message? encrypt
The encrypted message is: khoor

1. Encrypt/Decrypt a message
2. Exit
Enter choice: 2
Exiting the program.
```
